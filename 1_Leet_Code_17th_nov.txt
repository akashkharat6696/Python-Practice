# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#
# You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Enumerate what do
x = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
y = enumerate(x)
print(list(y))
output will be
[(0, 'apple'), (1, 'banana'), (2, 'cherry')]

# Code
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, v in enumerate(nums):
        remaining = target - v
        if remaining in seen:
            return [seen[remaining], i]
        seen[v] = i
    return []
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
target = 6
